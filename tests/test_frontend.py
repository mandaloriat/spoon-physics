    `scripts/fetch-widgets.sh` builds and copies the packages for a `pip install -e .`
    checkout; the Dockerfile's own `COPY --from=widgets` lines do it for the image. Neither
    can be derived from the other — one is a shell loop, the other is a list of layers — so a
    package added to one and not the other gives a container whose import map resolves to a
    404 while the developer's machine is fine.

    That is the ADR-007 failure with the pin swapped for a package, and it has the same
    symptom: nothing happens, and nothing says why. `@fenix-spoon/plot` was the fourth entry
    and the first one to be added since this pair existed, which is why this check exists now
    rather than earlier.
