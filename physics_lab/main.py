"""The lab application: Fenix Spoon's app, plus a static site and a health endpoint.

    uvicorn physics_lab.main:app

Three things are added to the app Fenix Spoon builds, and nothing is taken away:

1. ``GET /health`` — Fenix Spoon has no health endpoint, and a reverse proxy and a smoke
   test both need one.
2. The static lab site at ``/`` — served by this process so the browser talks to one
   origin and CORS never enters the picture.
3. A maintenance switch that refuses new job submissions while leaving the rest of the
   API and the whole site online.

The ``/api/v1`` protocol is untouched: no route is wrapped, no response is rewritten, no
model is subclassed. Everything above is additive, so upgrading the pin is a version bump
rather than a merge.

    Without the header a browser applies *heuristic* freshness — typically a tenth of the
    file's age since ``Last-Modified`` — and serves its cached copy without asking. The
    pages, the stylesheet and the modules are one hand-woven graph with no build step and
    no versioned filenames, so after a deploy that heuristic hands different visitors
    different generations of it: yesterday's ``lab.css`` under today's markup, last
    week's module importing a function that has moved. The older the previous deploy,
    the longer the mismatch lives — a returning visitor can read a broken page for days
    while every fresh browser sees a correct one (found the hard way when ADR-025's
    redesign restyled every page at once).

    ``no-cache`` means "store it, but revalidate before using it" — not "don't cache".
    Starlette already stamps every file response with ``ETag`` and ``Last-Modified``, so
    the revalidation is a conditional request answered ``304 Not Modified``: one
    round-trip per asset, no bytes re-sent, and every visitor is on the deployed
    generation from their next navigation. The header rides on the 304s as well (they
    refresh the stored copy's headers), which is what keeps this true for caches that
    were filled before this class existed.
