"""Lab-level configuration.

Everything that governs *simulation* — job timeouts, cell budgets, quotas, the store,
Redis — is Fenix Spoon's own configuration and is read by Fenix Spoon from the
``FENIXSPOON_*`` environment variables. None of it is re-declared here; duplicating a
default is how the two drift apart.

What lives here is only what the *lab* adds on top: which commit of Fenix Spoon this
deployment is pinned to, where the static site lives, and the one operational switch the
public demo needs (turning job submission off while keeping the site up).
