"""Steady conduction in an extruded heat sink, with convection *and* radiation off every face.

``docs/exercises/heat-sink.md``. Arrays in, arrays out, no Fenix Spoon import — the split every
lab adapter uses, so the physics can be checked against closed forms without a job, a server or
an envelope.

**What is solved.** ``div(k grad T) = 0`` on the cross-section of the extrusion, by finite
volumes on a tensor-product grid whose lines land exactly on every fin edge. The section is
genuinely prismatic, so this is the exact conduction problem rather than a slice through a
three-dimensional one (§2), and everything is per unit depth.

**What leaves the metal, and why there are two of them.** Every exposed face carries

    q = h (T - T_inf)  +  q_rad

with ``h`` from :mod:`physics_lab.solvers.correlations`, evaluated on the channel the fins
leave between them, and ``q_rad`` from a radiosity solve on each channel's enclosure using the
exact two-dimensional view factors of :mod:`physics_lab.solvers.viewfactors`. Omitting either
one gives a sink whose optimum fin count does not exist: constant ``h`` says more fins are
always better, and no radiation over-predicts the temperature rise of the nominal still-air case
by tens of percent while removing surface finish as a design variable altogether.

**Why the air is not solved.** §2.1. Conjugate natural convection would make ``h`` an output,
and it is the physically complete answer; nothing upstream solves a fluid, and a coupled
buoyant solve costs minutes per run where the exercise needs a sweep of twenty configurations.
The air is transparent in the infrared — homonuclear diatomics, no dipole moment — so radiation
needs no volumetric term either: the sink radiates *through* the air, not to it, and the whole
of it lives on the boundary. That is what makes this affordable without a fluid solve.

**Why it iterates.** Both couplings depend on the answer. ``h`` depends on the surface excess
temperature through the film properties and the Rayleigh number; the radiative flux goes as
``T^4`` and, inside a channel, on the temperature of the surface *opposite*. So the conduction
solve runs inside a Picard loop, each pass rebuilding the boundary coefficients from the
temperature the last pass produced. From a convection-only start it converges in a handful of
passes, and :class:`Solution` reports how many it took rather than hiding it.
