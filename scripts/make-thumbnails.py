"""Render each experiment's homepage thumbnail by *running its own solver*.

The homepage used to be three paragraphs in three boxes. What a visitor wants to know before
clicking is what the thing looks like when it works, and the honest way to show that is not a
stock illustration but the field the exercise actually computes. So every thumbnail on the
homepage is a real solve, produced by this script and committed as a PNG.

Committed rather than computed in the browser, because the alternative is worse in both
directions: solving on page load would spend the public job budget (ADR-010) on people who are
only looking, and a hand-drawn approximation would be a picture of nothing. A committed PNG is
reproducible — re-run this script and the bytes come back — and it costs one request.

    ./scripts/make-thumbnails.py            # writes frontend/assets/thumbnails/*.png

The colormaps are read out of the vendored viewer so a card and the page it links to colour
the same field the same way; there is no second palette to keep in step. Run
``./scripts/fetch-widgets.sh`` first.

No third-party imaging dependency: a PNG is a zlib stream in a container, and writing one
directly is forty lines against adding Pillow to a project that renders everything else in the
browser.
