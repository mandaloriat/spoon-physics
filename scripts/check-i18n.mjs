/**
 * The two languages, checked against each other and against the pages that use them.
 *
 * Four failures are possible once a lab has more than one language, and every one of them is
 * silent in a browser: a key the Italian catalogue never got, a key the pages ask for and
 * neither catalogue has, a placeholder that survives translation as literal `{value}`, and an
 * Italian `content.*.json` that has drifted from the English one it is a translation of. The
 * first shows English inside Italian prose, the second prints the key, the third prints a
 * brace, and the fourth quietly changes the exercise. None of them fails a test that only
 * loads a page.
 *
 * Run by `npm run check:i18n`, and by CI beside the formatter. It needs no browser and no
 * server: the catalogues are plain ES modules, so Node imports them directly.
