# Spoon Physics

**Interactive problems. Computed fields. Checkable answers.**

An interactive laboratory for exploring physical phenomena by changing geometries, materials
and boundary conditions, with fast previews and FEniCSx computations.

Live at **[lab.andolfatto.eu](https://lab.andolfatto.eu)** — the hostname is infrastructure,
not the name of the thing
([ADR-016](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-016--the-product-is-called-spoon-physics)).

> These models are for exploring ideas and comparing designs. They are
> not professional engineering tools.

The lab is an **application** built on
[Fenix Spoon](https://github.com/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon), which is the **toolkit**: the
wire protocol, the simulation server, the job lifecycle, the solver-adapter contract, the
browser widgets and the SDK all live there and are consumed here as a pinned dependency.
Nothing from it is copied into this repository. What this repository contains is the
teaching experience on top — the experiments, the explanations, the visual identity, the
public deployment and the service limits.

**The site reads in English or Italian**, with a switch at the top right of every page; the
choice is remembered and is shareable as `?lang=it`. Anything the *server* writes stays in the
language it wrote it in — the validity warnings inside a result, and the solver titles the API
publishes — and so do the code, the tests and the documentation. See
[ADR-020](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-020--the-site-is-bilingual-the-repository-is-not),
which supersedes part of
[ADR-011](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-011--english-throughout-site-included).

## Current challenges

Three challenges on the homepage, and one advanced lab on a shelf below them. Each challenge
runs the same loop — predict, try, improve, compare — and each states its mission twice: once in
words, which is what the page shows, and once in the units an engineer would state it in, which
stays in the model details. See [ADR-022](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-022--the-lab-is-a-set-of-challenges-and-the-explanation-comes-after-the-attempt).

| Challenge | Physics | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Find the wing's attitude** — *aerodynamics* | Ideal flow with a Kutta condition, by a panel method: hit a lift target without twisting too hard | **Available** — the first page built to the *exercise* contract |
| **Build a bridge that holds** — *statics* | A pin-jointed lattice by the direct stiffness method: build a truss across a gorge and carry the traffic on a steel budget, without buckling a member | **Available** — the one you draw |
| **How many fins do you actually need?** — *heat transfer* | Conduction in a finned extrusion with convection and radiation at the surfaces: an optimum that is not "more". Solvable on the cross-section or, since protocol 1.17, on the whole body | **Available** |
| **Magnetic field in a 2D section** — *magnetostatics* | Vector potential for an out-of-plane current, on a grid fitted to the iron: carry a required flux on an ampere-turn budget without leaking it | **Advanced lab.** Written for readers who already know flux and magnetic circuits. Not a challenge: its mission is a flux in Wb/m, which has no outcome a student can picture. The electromagnet meant to replace it — pull a plate on a power budget — is specified and unbuilt |

Each page also numbers *itself* — "Exercise 1", "Exercise 3", "Exercise 4" — and that number is its
row in [the contract's list of exercises](docs/exercise-contract.md#7-the-exercises), not the order
the pages were built in. The two differ because the list has rows nobody has built yet: the bridge
is Exercise 4 there and the third one built here.

The three experiments deliberately exercise different halves of the protocol. The airfoil
sends `domain2d` — one polygon cut out of a rectangle, edited by dragging control points.
The magnetic circuit sends `regions2d`, a filled domain whose *material* varies by region, so
there is no outline to drag and the controls are physical dimensions instead; see
[ADR-012](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-012--the-second-experiment-shares-a-page-shell-and-brings-its-own-geometry-controls).
That difference reaches all the way into the parameter panels: on the magnetics page the
physics travels in the geometry, so *every* solver parameter is numerical and the contract's
"physical inputs" group is the cross-section itself.

The bridge exercises the half neither of them touches — **named boundaries and load cases**
(protocol 1.8 and 1.9) — and finds the edge of the geometry schema doing it. A truss is a
*network*: joints and bars. That is neither of the two geometry kinds and not a near miss
either, so the site travels as `regions2d` with a name for every place a condition can attach
to, the lattice travels as a parameter, and what the bridge is asked to carry travels as a
load case. The gap is recorded as a finding rather than papered over:
[ADR-019](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-019--the-bridge-carries-its-lattice-in-params-because-the-protocol-has-no-network-geometry).

The heat sink exercises the half that did not exist until recently: **a body with a length**
(protocol 1.17). Its cross-section solver is exact for an extrusion and assumes the device heats
it evenly along the whole of it — which a 30 mm die on a 60 mm extrusion does not. So the page
also offers `lab.heatsink3d`, which takes `regions3d`, reads the length off the geometry instead
of out of a parameter, and reports the **spreading resistance** that assumption was hiding, the
two cut ends that pay part of it back, and the plane model's own answer beside them. What comes
back is a `mesh3d`, and the page draws it by asking for a `slice` — a `grid2d`, which the viewer
has drawn since 1.0, so three dimensions cost the browser nothing
([ADR-023](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-023--the-heat-sink-gets-a-third-dimension-and-what-it-buys-is-the-spreading-resistance)).

The remaining experiment has its preview solver upstream already; what it needs is the
didactic work. The homepage lists it as planned rather than pretending otherwise.

Five of the lab's solvers are its own, in `physics_lab/solvers/`, and in each case the reason
was physics a metric needed rather than a wish to demonstrate the adapter contract: upstream's
potential-flow adapters impose no Kutta condition, so their lift is exactly zero
([ADR-014](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-014--the-airfoil-exercise-ships-ideal-flow-with-a-kutta-condition-first));
upstream's magnetostatics adapter rasterises the iron/air interface onto a uniform grid, so
a 20.000 mm core comes out 20.339 mm wide at one resolution and 20.084 mm at another
([ADR-018](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-018--the-magnetics-exercise-gets-its-own-solver-and-its-challenge-is-not-a-gap-force));
upstream's elasticity adapters solve a *continuum*, which has no members to report a force
in — a truss is a graph, not a body meshed finely
([ADR-019](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-019--the-bridge-carries-its-lattice-in-params-because-the-protocol-has-no-network-geometry));
and upstream's two conduction adapters declare `no_radiation`, whose own assumption text calls
radiation *"not negligible for a hot surface in still air"* — which is the heat sink's nominal
case. That last reason holds in three dimensions as well as two, which is why the heat sink is
the one exercise with two adapters rather than one
([ADR-023](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-023--the-heat-sink-gets-a-third-dimension-and-what-it-buys-is-the-spreading-resistance)).

### Exercises, not demonstrations

A demonstration asks *what changes in the field?* — a question with no wrong answer, so nothing
can be compared and nothing improved. An **exercise** sets a quantitative target under
constraints, reports the engineering metrics that answer it, and says on every run how far those
numbers can be trusted. Every page has the same nine sections: problem, model, boundary
conditions, initial conditions *only* where the problem is transient, physical inputs, fields,
engineering metrics, verification, saved result.

An exercise is still an exercise when it has a door. The airfoil page opens with a short
**guided path** — how the air holds a wing up, why what you are looking at is a two-dimensional
slice, what the four digits of a NACA number mean, and then six angles of attack to press — and
every chapter carries the same *Go to the simulator* control, which is remembered so a second
visit lands on the bench. It adds nothing to the nine sections and removes nothing from them; it
exists because *"800 N/m of sectional lift, keeping |C_m,c/4| below 0.08"* is a precise, correct
sentence and a wall for anybody who has never met a wing section. The Fenix Spoon demo already
shows what the toolkit can do; the lesson is the thing only this side can build
([ADR-021](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-021--an-exercise-page-opens-with-a-lesson-and-the-lesson-can-be-skipped)).
The other three pages open the way they always did — their chapters are physics prose still to
be written.

- The contract every page implements: **[docs/exercise-contract.md](docs/exercise-contract.md)**
  ([ADR-013](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-013--the-pages-become-exercises-not-demonstrations)).
- The first one, specified and built: **[docs/exercises/airfoil.md](docs/exercises/airfoil.md)**.
  It began by fixing the physics — the old model imposed no Kutta condition, so its lift was
  exactly zero at every incidence
  ([ADR-014](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-014--the-airfoil-exercise-ships-ideal-flow-with-a-kutta-condition-first)).
- The second, built after a release spent deliberately refusing to build it:
  **[docs/exercises/solenoid.md](docs/exercises/solenoid.md)**. Every metric a magnetic design
  is judged on needs a definition in a two-dimensional slice, and none had been verified, so
  the page reported the field and nothing else. They now are — and two of the specification's
  own predictions did not survive being measured. There is no peak flux density on that page,
  because the core's corner is a singularity and the peak climbs with every refinement instead
  of converging; and there is no gap force, because a symmetric bar core feels exactly zero, so
  the challenge is set in flux instead
  ([ADR-018](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-018--the-magnetics-exercise-gets-its-own-solver-and-its-challenge-is-not-a-gap-force)).
- The third, and the first the visitor *draws*:
  **[docs/exercises/truss.md](docs/exercises/truss.md)**. Lay out joints and bars across a
  gorge, put the supports where the ground can take them, and find out which member gives way
  — almost never the one you expect, because a slender bar buckles at a fraction of the force
  that would yield it. It is also the exercise that found the edge of the geometry schema: a
  bar network is neither of the two kinds the protocol has
  ([ADR-019](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-019--the-bridge-carries-its-lattice-in-params-because-the-protocol-has-no-network-geometry)).
- **[docs/exercises/heat-sink.md](docs/exercises/heat-sink.md)** — ~~specified, not built~~
  **built**, and it was the one waiting on nothing upstream. Writing it turned up two reasons the upstream demo is not
  yet a lesson, and both are about the boundary rather than the solve. The convection coefficient
  is a constant — the solver says so, and excludes fin-to-fin interference by name — so with `h`
  fixed, thermal resistance falls monotonically with fin count and the model claims more fins are
  always better; the home page card asks *when do they stop?* and the answer only exists once `h`
  depends on the channel the fins leave between them. And radiation is switched off, which the
  same solver warns is *"not negligible for a hot surface in still air"* — the nominal case
  exactly. Putting it back gives the curve a second reason to turn, since fins packed close
  radiate at each other instead of at the room, and it makes surface finish a design variable.

  It also costs the exercise the property the first draft was proudest of. A radiative boundary
  is physics upstream does not have, so the lab writes `lab.heatsink2d` after all — which is the
  rule working rather than an exception to it.

  The method is built and verified (`physics_lab/solvers/heatsink.py`), and it settled three
  things the specification could only assert. The optimum fin count **is** interior — thermal
  resistance falls to a minimum and then trebles — and it **disappears** the moment the
  coefficient is pinned, which is the control case the tests keep. Radiation carries about half
  the heat off an unfinned plate and only a seventh off the finned nominal, because the channels
  have hidden the metal from the room; ignoring it still over-predicts the temperature rise by
  12% at the optimum and 57% past it. And the two mechanisms turn out to **fight each other** —
  fins added to help convection suppress radiation — so anodising is worth 36% of the rise on a
  plate and 8% on a tightly finned sink. The first draft quoted the flattering number for both.
- **[docs/exercises/capacitive-sensor.md](docs/exercises/capacitive-sensor.md)** — **built**.
  The position sensor whose calibration curve the mirror's controller runs on: an annular
  electrode 90 micrometres from a mirror, and the first exercise here whose *answer is a curve*.
  Sensitivity is a slope, the usable stroke is a tolerance on a straight line through it, and
  the tilt cross-sensitivity is a quadrature over it — so one press is a sweep of gaps and a fit,
  and none of the three is a reduction of any single field. That is also why the lab wrote a
  solver where upstream ships two adapters for this very geometry kind
  ([ADR-026](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-026--the-sensor-gets-its-own-solver-although-upstream-has-the-physics-and-the-reason-is-that-a-calibration-is-a-curve)).

  It is the one page here checked against a number this project did not produce: a measurement
  published in 2015. That check paid for itself on its first run, catching a capacitance four
  times too small that had a consistent linear system, two agreeing routes and a
  machine-precision residual behind it. It also settled a question the source leaves open —
  the printed tilt coefficient is per *degree* squared, by a factor of three thousand — and it
  turned up that upstream's `mock.electrostatics_axi2d` cannot reach this configuration at all:
  on a 90 µm gap in a 10 mm window its capacitance is about half the measured one and is not
  monotone in resolution.
- One more, **specified and not built**, from the same `P45` archive and 2015 thesis:
  **[docs/exercises/adaptive-mirror.md](docs/exercises/adaptive-mirror.md)**, the mirror itself.
  It and the sensor were each blocked on something the toolkit did not have, and on a
  *different* something, which is what made the two independent — and the pin's move to protocol
  1.17 opened both. The sensor wanted an axisymmetric geometry kind
  ([fenix-spoon#100](https://github.com/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon/issues/100), closed, landed in
  1.13). The mirror wanted a plate element *and* an eigenvalue solve
  (**[docs/proposals/mindlin-plate-and-modes.md](docs/proposals/mindlin-plate-and-modes.md)**,
  which argues those are two asks with different owners rather than one): the eigensolve arrived
  in 1.14 ([#101](https://github.com/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon/issues/101), closed), and the plate
  element — the lab's own to write — is what still stands.

### A page is a bench

Containing the nine sections is not the same as showing them all at once, and the first version
of the airfoil page did the second: 7,664 pixels tall, a 310-pixel column of twelve controls each
with a paragraph under it, Run above most of the inputs that feed it, three panels reading
"Nothing computed yet", and the field itself about a ninth of the first screen.

Every experiment page is now arranged as one path — **mission → configure → run → explore →
check → keep and compare → understand the model** — with the computed field as the largest thing
on it and its own toolbar: pan, zoom, fit, reset, probe, vector glyphs, streamlines, annotation
layers and image export. A tool the current result cannot support is **disabled with its
reason** rather than absent. The explanations are not shortened; they are folded into
*Understand the model*. See
[ADR-017](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-017--an-experiment-page-is-a-bench-not-a-document)
and [the contract's §7a](docs/exercise-contract.md#7a-the-order-a-page-presents-them-in).

## Architecture

```
Browser
   │
   ▼
lab.andolfatto.eu
   │
   ▼
Caddy  ── HTTPS, HTTP/3, security headers, WebSocket upgrade
   │
   ▼
physics_lab  ── the Fenix Spoon app + the static site + /health, one origin
   │
   ▼
Redis  ── arq queue + progress pub/sub
   │
   ▼
worker (FEniCSx)  ── one solve per container, shared data volume with the API
```

The front-end and the API are the same origin by design, so CORS never enters the picture
and the pages contain no hostname at all
([ADR-003](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-003--the-front-end-and-the-api-share-one-origin)).
In development the API solves in its own process and there is no Redis and no worker.

### What this repository adds to Fenix Spoon

Three things, all additive — no route is wrapped, no response rewritten, no model
subclassed:

1. **`GET /health`** — Fenix Spoon has none, and a reverse proxy, a container health check
   and a smoke test all need one. It reports the pinned commit, the dolfinx version, the
   installed solvers and whether the lab is accepting jobs.
2. **The static site at `/`**, served by the same process as the API.
3. **A maintenance switch** (`PHYSICS_LAB_JOBS_ENABLED=false`) that refuses new
   submissions while leaving the site, the catalogue and every finished result online.

### Layout

---

## Quick start

### Without Docker

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # pulls Fenix Spoon from the pinned commit
./scripts/fetch-widgets.sh       # builds the browser widgets from that same commit
uvicorn physics_lab.main:app --reload
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. The mock solvers are always available, so the whole
loop — edit the profile, submit, stream progress, render the field, download the VTK —
works without FEniCSx installed.

### With Docker (mock solvers, ~100 MB base)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
./scripts/smoke-test.sh http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

`compose.override.yaml` is picked up automatically and publishes port 8000 on `127.0.0.1`
only.

### With FEniCSx

The FEniCSx solvers register only where dolfinx imports, which means the full image:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file .env \
  -f compose.yaml -f compose.override.yaml \
  build --build-arg FENIX_SPOON_IMAGE=ghcr.io/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon:sha-3d483a3
docker compose up -d
```

The base image is about 3 GB, so the first build is slow. Confirm it worked:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health | python3 -m json.tool   # solvers should list dolfinx.*
```

The experiment page then offers both modes. Where it does not, it says so and stays fully
usable on the preview solver — nothing about the page assumes FEniCSx is present.

---

## Production

### 1. DNS

One record, pointing at the server:

| Type | Name | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `A` | `lab` (i.e. `lab.andolfatto.eu`) | the server's public IPv4 |
| `AAAA` | `lab` | the server's public IPv6, if it has one |

No CNAME, no wildcard, no separate `api.` name — the lab is one hostname
([ADR-003](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-003--the-front-end-and-the-api-share-one-origin)).

Verify before deploying, because Let's Encrypt rate-limits failures:

```bash
dig +short lab.andolfatto.eu A
```

### 2. Ports

Both must be reachable from the internet:

- **80/tcp** — the ACME HTTP-01 challenge, and the HTTP→HTTPS redirect. Leaving it closed
  is the single most common reason certificate issuance fails.
- **443/tcp and 443/udp** — the site, and HTTP/3.

Nothing else is published. The API, Redis and the workers are reachable only on the
compose network.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp && sudo ufw allow 443/udp
```

### 3. Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mandaloriat/spoon-physics.git
cd spoon-physics
cp .env.example .env          # set LAB_DOMAIN; everything else has a working default
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml up -d --build
```

Or `./scripts/deploy.sh`, which does the same and then runs the smoke test, telling you how
to roll back if it fails.

Scale the solving capacity independently of the API:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml up -d --scale worker=3
```

### 4. Verify the certificate

```bash
curl -sI https://lab.andolfatto.eu | head -3
echo | openssl s_client -connect lab.andolfatto.eu:443 -servername lab.andolfatto.eu 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -noout -issuer -dates
```

Issuer should be Let's Encrypt and `notAfter` about 90 days out. Caddy renews at two
thirds of the lifetime with no cron job to configure.

### 5. Verify the WebSocket

The progress stream is a WebSocket; a proxy that does not upgrade it makes the UI look
hung while everything else appears fine. Check the handshake directly:

```bash
# The key is any 16 random bytes, base64-encoded — the handshake does not care which.
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
  -H 'Connection: Upgrade' -H 'Upgrade: websocket' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13' -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Key: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==' \
  https://lab.andolfatto.eu/api/v1/jobs/does-not-exist/events
```

`101` means the upgrade happened (the job id is then rejected by the application, which is
the point — the proxy did its part). Anything else, and Caddy is not upgrading.

The end-to-end proof is the browser suite, which uses only the WebSocket to wait for a
result:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
BASE_URL=https://lab.andolfatto.eu npx playwright test
```

### 6. Roll back

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --rollback        # previous commit, rebuilt, smoke-tested
```

or by hand:

```bash
git checkout <previous-sha>
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml up -d --build
```

The data volume is untouched by either, so finished jobs survive a rollback. Rolling back
across a Fenix Spoon pin bump also reverts the base image, since the tag is a build
argument.

### 7. Deploy on a timer

`scripts/auto-deploy.sh` is the unattended version of step 3: it fetches, and when
`origin/main` has moved ahead of the checkout it runs `deploy.sh` for you. In cron:

```cron
*/15 * * * * /home/deploy/apps/physics-lab/scripts/auto-deploy.sh >> /home/deploy/apps/physics-lab/.auto-deploy/auto-deploy.log 2>&1
```

It deploys only a clean fast-forward of `main`. A checkout that is dirty, detached, ahead
of the remote or diverged from it means someone is working on the box by hand, and the
script says so in the log and does nothing. When a deploy fails its smoke test it puts the
previously serving revision back — `deploy.sh` has already started the broken one by the
time the smoke test speaks — and records the failed revision in `.auto-deploy/`, so the
next tick waits for a newer commit instead of rebuilding the same failure every quarter of
an hour. `--force` retries a revision that failed; deleting
`.auto-deploy/failed-revision` does the same.

Nothing about this is required: a box without the cron entry behaves exactly as before.

---

## Operating it

### Logs

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml logs -f api
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml logs -f worker
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml logs -f caddy
```

Rotation is configured in the compose files (`max-size: 10m`, `max-file: 5`), so a
long-lived container cannot fill the disk. To apply the same globally, set
`log-driver`/`log-opts` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and restart Docker.

### Turning simulations off without taking the site down

```bash
sed -i 's/^PHYSICS_LAB_JOBS_ENABLED=.*/PHYSICS_LAB_JOBS_ENABLED=false/' .env
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml up -d --no-deps api
```

New submissions get a `503` with a `Retry-After`; the pages, the catalogue, every finished
result and every artifact stay available, and the front-end shows a banner instead of a Run
button. Reverse it the same way.

### Backup

The data volume is the only durable state — job records, result payloads and artifacts all
live in one directory, which is Fenix Spoon's durability contract.

```bash
docker run --rm -v physics-lab_lab-data:/data:ro -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/lab-data-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /data .
```

Restore into a stopped stack:

```bash
docker run --rm -v physics-lab_lab-data:/data -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
  sh -c 'rm -rf /data/* && tar xzf /backup/lab-data-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz -C /data'
```

There is nothing personal in it: the lab has no accounts, no cookies, no analytics and no
uploads, so a backup contains geometries and fields and nothing else.

### Deleting all demo data

Records expire on their own after `FENIXSPOON_JOB_TTL` (24 hours by default), swept hourly
and at startup. To wipe everything now:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml down
docker volume rm physics-lab_lab-data
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml up -d
```

That removes the job database, every result payload and every artifact. Nothing else in
the stack holds simulation data — Redis carries only the queue and live progress and is
started with persistence off.

### Updating Fenix Spoon

The pin is deliberate and lives in several files, all of which must agree. The full
procedure, including how to check that the images exist for a new commit, is
[ADR-007](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-007--the-dependency-is-pinned-to-a-commit-in-four-places-checked-by-a-script).
The short version:

```bash
# edit the SHA in pyproject.toml, Dockerfile, compose*.yaml, .env.example,
# scripts/fetch-widgets.sh, physics_lab/settings.py — and the image tags
./scripts/check-pins.sh                       # must pass first
FORCE=1 ./scripts/fetch-widgets.sh
pip install -e ".[dev]" --force-reinstall --no-deps
pytest && npx playwright test
```

## The pinned dependency

| What | Value |
|---|---|
| Fenix Spoon commit | `3d483a38d619b3b6c2d88e798ca0be5420d5ef6d` |
| FEniCSx base image | `ghcr.io/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon:sha-3d483a3` — digest `sha256:58b368b7d64399a2070e72429db5f837bc03f0bb3a40dac4c13a24c01f05a07c` |
| Mock-only base image | `ghcr.io/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon:sha-3d483a3-slim` — digest `sha256:515834de44a656e345d57a9923517334ed3764e630ee10b44b86c7c90e2f61e6` |
| dolfinx | v0.11.0 |

Upstream tagged **v0.1.0** on 2026-08-06, and the pin is still a commit: the tag points at
`b556e4a`, three commits before `regions3d` exists, so pinning to the release would pin away
the 3-D geometry the heat sink now sends (ADR-007). `:latest` and `:latest-slim` exist in GHCR
from that tag onwards — earlier revisions of this file said they did not — but they point at
the release, not at this commit. Do not "fix" a pull failure by switching to them.

`/health` reports the pin at runtime, so a deployed container can be asked what it is made
of rather than identified by a tag someone may have retagged.

## Security and the limits of a public demo

The lab is anonymous by design: no accounts, no API keys, no cookies, no analytics, no
uploads. What protects it:

| Control | Where |
|---|---|
| Cell budget refused at submit, in prose the page prints | `FENIXSPOON_MAX_CELLS=200000` |
| Wall-clock timeout | `FENIXSPOON_JOB_TIMEOUT=90` |
| Concurrent and hourly job caps | `FENIXSPOON_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`, `FENIXSPOON_MAX_JOBS_PER_HOUR` |
| Hard per-job memory ceiling | `LAB_WORKER_MEMORY=2G`, enforceable because one solve is one process |
| One solve per worker container | `FENIXSPOON_WORKER_CONCURRENCY=1` |
| Short retention | `FENIXSPOON_JOB_TTL=86400` |
| Request body limit | `request_body max_size 1MB` in the Caddyfile |
| HSTS, CSP, nosniff, frame and referrer policy | Caddyfile `header` block |
| Redis unreachable from outside | no published port, no persistence |
| Unprivileged container user | `USER lab` (uid 10001) in the Dockerfile |
| No arbitrary execution | Fenix Spoon's protocol exposes *named solvers with typed parameters*. A client chooses **what** to solve from a server-defined menu, never **how**: no Python, no UFL, no shell. |
| No admin surface | there is none to expose |
| No secrets in the front-end | every request is same-origin and relative; a test enforces it |

**The gap, stated plainly.** In anonymous mode every visitor is Fenix Spoon's `anonymous`
principal, so the quotas are *server-wide*. They cap total load correctly and do nothing
against one abusive client: a single script can spend the whole hourly budget and lock
everyone else out without tripping a per-user limit. Per-IP limiting is the missing half
and belongs in the reverse proxy, which is the only layer that sees the client address. The
Caddyfile carries the configuration and the `xcaddy` build it needs, commented out, with a
note on when to turn it on. See
[ADR-010](docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-010--public-demo-limits-and-what-they-do-not-cover).

Two front-end decisions follow from the same arithmetic: the experiment page never solves
automatically — not on load, not on drag — and it reads `jobs_enabled` from `/health` so a
maintenance window shows a banner rather than a button that 503s.

## Development

```bash
pytest                     # the API seam and the served site
ruff check .               # lint
mypy                       # type check
./scripts/check-pins.sh    # every Fenix Spoon reference agrees
npm run check:i18n         # the two languages agree, and the pages ask for keys that exist
./scripts/make-thumbnails.py   # regenerate the homepage cards from real solves

npm install && npx playwright install chromium
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npx playwright test    # the browser loop
./scripts/smoke-test.sh                               # against a running deployment
```

Fenix Spoon's own suite already proves the protocol, the job lifecycle, the store and the
solvers — it is a dependency, and re-testing it here would be duplicated maintenance with
no extra coverage. These tests cover the seam and the lab's own additions.

### Testing the production proxy locally

The `Caddyfile` is the production config and can be put in front of a local server
unchanged, WebSocket and security headers included — which is how it gets tested at all,
given that a certificate needs a public name:

```bash
uvicorn physics_lab.main:app --port 8000 &
LAB_DOMAIN=:9080 LAB_UPSTREAM=127.0.0.1:8000 caddy run --config Caddyfile
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9080 npx playwright test
```

A bare `:port` site address turns automatic HTTPS off, so nothing else has to change.

### Adding an experiment

1. A directory under `frontend/experiments/`, with `index.html`, `app.js`, `content.json`
   and `content.it.json`. The two existing experiments are the references, and they differ
   on purpose: the airfoil edits its geometry with a widget, the solenoid builds it from
   physical sliders.
2. `app.js` supplies the physics and takes the rest from `shared/experiment.js` — the
   parameter form (generated from the solver's own `params_schema`, never hardcoded), the
   solver picker, the run loop, the result panel and the lesson renderer. What each
   experiment writes for itself is the geometry, a `FIELD_VIEW` table saying how to read
   each field, and any quantity worth deriving in the browser from what the solver returned
   (`Cp` for the airfoil, `H` for the solenoid).
3. Its wording in both `frontend/shared/strings/en.js` and `it.js`, under a block named
   after the experiment. Nothing in `app.js` or `index.html` holds a sentence of its own:
   the script calls `t('yours.something')` and the markup carries `data-i18n`. `npm run
   check:i18n` fails on a key one language has and the other does not.
4. A card on the homepage, and the experiment's name in `EXPERIMENTS` in
   `tests/test_frontend.py`, which then checks its assets, its import map and the shape of
   its `content.json` in every language — including that it documents the limits of its own
   model.
5. If Fenix Spoon has no solver for it, an adapter in `physics_lab/solvers/`. That package
   is already imported before the app is built, and again by `physics_lab.worker` — the
   module the worker containers run — so `@register` is the whole integration. Sharing an
   image with the API is not what makes an adapter available in a worker; importing the
   package in the process arq runs is. It must implement Fenix Spoon's public `Solver`
   contract; nothing about it is lab-specific.
