/**
 * The magnetic circuit — the solenoid cross-section, as an exercise.
 *
 * The second experiment, and the first one whose geometry is about *materials* rather than an
 * obstacle. `regions2d` fills the whole rectangle and lets the physics vary by region: an iron
 * core, two windings carrying opposite-signed current density (the two sides of one coil cut by
 * the plane), and air everywhere else. The solver solves for the magnetic vector potential,
 *
 *     −div( (1/μ) grad A_z ) = J_z ,      B = ( ∂A_z/∂y , −∂A_z/∂x )
 *
 * with A_z = 0 on the outer boundary.
 *
 * There is no geometry widget on this page and that is not an omission: `<fs-geometry-2d>`
 * edits a `domain2d` outline, which is a different geometry kind with different physics behind
 * it. Nested material rectangles are better described by the quantities an engineer would
 * actually name — bore, winding thickness, permeability — so the controls are those quantities
 * and the cross-section is drawn from them.
 *
 * **Now an exercise.** It was a demonstration for two releases, because an exercise needs
 * metrics and every metric a magnetic design is judged on needed a definition in a 2-D slice
 * that had not been verified here. `lab.magnetics2d` settles them and checks them, so this page
 * now carries a challenge, a metrics table, five verification residuals and a run table. Two of
 * the specification's own predictions did not survive being measured, and both are stated on
 * the page rather than only in the repository: there is no peak flux density, and there is no
 * gap force. See `docs/exercises/solenoid.md` and ADR-018.
