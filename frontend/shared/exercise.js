 * residual is above the stated threshold cannot pass either; and the target is never rewritten.
 *
 * **Meaning before symbol.** A target names a metric by the key the report uses — `l_prime`,
 * `c_m_c4` — and printing that key told a visitor about the lab's variable names rather than
 * about aerodynamics. Printing `|C_m,c/4| < 0.08` was the next version of the same mistake: it
 * is correct, and it is unreadable to somebody meeting a pitching moment for the first time. So
 * each label may now carry a `plain` wording, which is what the challenge shows; the symbol
 * moves into the tooltip, where it is available the moment it means something. A key with no
 * entry falls back to the key, so a new metric is visibly unlabelled rather than silently
 * mislabelled.
