/**
 * The workspace: the field, the tools that interrogate it, and the annotations over it.
 *
 * This is the part of the redesign that changes what a page *is*. Before it, an experiment
 * page was a document with a picture in it: the picture had a fixed size, no tools, and no way
 * to ask it anything except by hovering. A laboratory instrument is the other way round — the
 * measurement is the centre of the bench and everything else is arranged around it.
 *
 * **What belongs to Fenix Spoon and what belongs here.** `<fs-viewer>` draws the field,
 * probes it, samples vector glyphs and exports its canvas; those are used, never
 * reimplemented. What the pin has no API for is a *view transform* (pan and zoom), a
 * *locked colour range*, *streamlines*, and *annotations in domain coordinates*. Three of
 * those four are supplied here in a way that cannot drift from the widget:
 *
 * - **pan and zoom** are laid out around the element rather than inside it. The viewer is
 *   given a larger box and a clipping parent scrolls it. The widget re-renders at whatever
 *   size it is handed, so zooming in re-rasterises rather than magnifying pixels, `probe()`
 *   keeps working because the widget computes from its own bounding rect, and the day the
 *   viewer gains a real view transform this layer is deleted rather than migrated.
 * - **the colorbar is drawn here**, from the viewer's own `range` and upstream's own
 *   `sampleColormap` / `colorbarTicks`. That is not duplication for its own sake: turning the
 *   widget's colorbar off (`colorbar="off"`) is what makes the plot area *exactly* the
 *   element's box, and therefore what lets an overlay align with the field without
 *   reproducing the widget's internal layout constants — the hazard
 *   [ADR-012](../../docs/architecture-decisions.md#adr-012) names. It also fixes a real
 *   misalignment: with the bar on, the widget stretches the domain into `width - 38px` while
 *   `<fs-geometry-2d>` uses the full width, so the draggable outline sat several per cent to
 *   the right of the hole it was supposed to be.
 * - **streamlines** are integrated from the vector field the solver publishes, and are
 *   offered *only* when it does. A curve that is not an integral of the velocity is not a
 *   streamline and this module will not draw one.
 *
 * **Locking the colour range is not possible on this pin** and is therefore offered as a
 * disabled tool that says so. `<fs-viewer>` computes its range privately from the data and
 * exposes only a getter; a legend claiming a range the canvas does not use would be a lie
 * about the picture. {@link viewerCapabilities} feature-detects a settable range so that the
 * control turns itself on when a future pin provides one.
 *
 * Still functions over DOM nodes: no component model, no reactive store, no build step. See
 * ADR-009 and ADR-017.
