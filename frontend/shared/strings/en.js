/**
 * Every word the lab says in English.
 *
 * This file is the wording's home: the pages carry `data-i18n` hooks and the modules call
 * `t('some.key')`, so a sentence is changed here once rather than in the markup, the script and
 * the test that reads it. `strings/it.js` mirrors it key for key — a key present here and
 * missing there falls back to this text and says so in the console (see `shared/i18n.js`).
 *
 * The keys are grouped the way the lab is: shared chrome first, then the shared renderers, then
 * one block per exercise. A value may carry `{placeholders}` and, where the key is read through
 * `data-i18n-html`, inline markup — nothing here is ever built from anything a visitor typed.
 *
 * **Not here, on purpose.** Two kinds of user-visible text come from the server and are shown
 * as it wrote them: the validity warnings inside `report.json`, and the title and description of
 * each capability from `GET /api/v1/solvers`. Translating those means teaching the solvers a
 * language, not the page — ADR-020 says why that was left for later, and where it would go.
