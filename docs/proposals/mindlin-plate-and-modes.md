# The Mindlin plate and the modal solve — a business case

**Status:** proposal. Nothing is decided here, and there is no ADR yet: an ADR records a
decision taken, and this document exists to ask for one.
**Occasion:** [Exercise 6, the adaptive mirror](../exercises/adaptive-mirror.md) is specified
and blocked, and its §11 names the plate element as *"the exercise's real technical risk"*.
This is the case for retiring that risk before anyone writes the exercise around it.
**Related:** [fenix-spoon#100](https://github.com/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon/issues/100), the
same argument made for `axisymmetric2d` and [Exercise 5](../exercises/capacitive-sensor.md).

## 1. It is two asks, not one, and they have different owners

The natural way to state this is *"the lab needs a Mindlin plate and its modes"*. Stated that
way it is one large request to one place, and it is wrong on both counts. Separated:

| | The ask | Kind of thing | Belongs to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | an **eigenvalue solve** — the toolkit can answer *"where does it resonate?"* | a question kind | **Fenix Spoon** |
| **B** | a **Mindlin plate element** — bending of a thin shear-deformable plate | physics | **the lab**, and offered upstream afterwards |

The separation is worth insisting on because A is much the stronger case, is much the smaller
piece of work, and is useful to physics the toolkit *already* ships. Bundling it behind a plate
element hides a good argument behind a hard one.

---

## 2. Ask A — the modal solve, and why it is upstream's

Four pieces of evidence, all of them from Fenix Spoon's own source rather than from what the
lab would like.

**The protocol already describes the answer.** The `series1d` module docstring lists what a
curve is for, and the fourth row of its table is:

> | Where does it resonate? | a frequency sweep, or a list of modal frequencies |

— `server/fenixspoon/series.py`, repeated verbatim in `docs/04-wire-protocol.md`. The result
shape shipped in protocol 1.5. **Nothing on the server can produce one.** A wire format with no
producer is the clearest possible statement that a capability was anticipated and not built.

**The vocabulary already has the word.** `declarations.py` gives the static elasticity solvers
this assumption:

> `static` — *"No inertia and no time: the answer is the equilibrium reached under a load
> applied slowly. Natural frequencies, impact and any dynamic amplification are outside it."*
> `excludes=["natural_frequency", "transient_response", "dynamic_amplification"]`

`natural_frequency` is a name the toolkit already uses — to tell a caller what it cannot have.
Of the three things that assumption excludes, `transient_response` has a solver
(`dolfinx.transient_heat2d`) and `natural_frequency` has none.

**It is a question kind, and question kinds have always been upstream's.** Every registered
adapter — poisson, laplace, heat, transient heat, magnetostatics, elasticity, aerodynamics —
is a *forward* solve, steady or marched in time. An eigenproblem is a third kind of question,
in the same way M5's optimisation loop is a fourth. That is the axis the toolkit grows along,
and it is not the axis a lab adapter grows along.

**There is a second consumer, from different physics.** The contract's *Room modes* row wants
the analytic modes of a rectangular room — acoustics, not structures, and the same question.
Two independent cases is the bar [#100](https://github.com/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon/issues/100)
just used, and it is met here without counting the mirror twice.

**What it would cost the protocol: possibly nothing.** Frequencies are a `series1d`. Mode
shapes are fields of the kinds the viewer already draws. `frames` (protocol 1.7) already orders
a list of artifacts, and a mode index is an ordering — whether a mode number may travel in a
slot whose field is named `t` is the one real question, and it is a smaller one than a new
result kind.

---

## 3. Ask B — the plate element, and why the lab writes it first

Upstream ships `mock.elasticity2d` and `dolfinx.elasticity2d`, and they are plane continuum.
The toolkit says so itself, in the assumption those solvers declare:

> `plane_idealisation` — *"…**Neither is a thin bending plate**, and the two differ by terms of
> order nu in every stress — picking the wrong one is a quiet error, not a refusal."*
> `excludes=["plate_bending", "out_of_plane_load"]`

So the gap is not something the lab discovered. It is named in the toolkit's own prose, and
excluded by name, twice.

**And yet the recommendation is that the lab writes it.** By the test
[ADR-019](../architecture-decisions.md#adr-019--the-bridge-carries-its-lattice-in-params-because-the-protocol-has-no-network-geometry)
settled — *a solver of the lab's own only when the physics a metric needs is missing, never to
demonstrate the adapter contract* — this qualifies, exactly as the panel method and the truss
did. The honest counter-argument should be stated rather than skipped: a Mindlin plate is a
*standard element*, general in a way `panel.py` and `truss2d.py` are not, and the lab writing
one is the first time it would be building something whose natural home is a toolkit.

The resolution is a sequence rather than a verdict:

1. the lab writes the element and runs it against the fifty published frequencies;
2. **then** it is offered upstream, with the benchmark attached.

A plate element carrying fifty externally published numbers is a contribution someone can
accept in an afternoon. The same element as a proposal is a conversation. Doing it in this
order also puts the element where its benchmark already lives, and costs nothing if the answer
upstream is eventually no.

## 4. The risk, and the spike that retires it

The risk has a name: **shear locking**. At 1.61 mm of Zerodur over a 163 mm annular width this
plate is thin enough that an un-stabilised Mindlin element returns frequencies that are too
high and entirely plausible. It is the failure mode that does not announce itself — which is
precisely why the exercise should not be built first and checked afterwards.

**The spike, in one sentence:** assemble **K** and **M** for the free annular plate with its 45
point masses and magnet stiffnesses, solve the generalised eigenproblem, and compare.

| What it must produce | Expected |
|---|---|
| rigid-body modes | **exactly three** at zero — piston and two tilts |
| first elastic mode | **112.8 Hz**, and it is a degenerate pair |
| the sequence | 182.3, 276.6, 276.7, 417.2, 417.3, 485.1, 485.2 … |
| the fiftieth | **2640.9 Hz** |

Getting the first three to be zero and the fourth to be 112.8 Hz means the element, the
concentrated masses and the magnet stiffness are all right at once — §8 of the exercise says
so, and it is why this check is worth more than its cost.

**What the spike needs: nothing that is currently blocked.**

- Not `axisymmetric2d` — this is a plane annular domain, and the two P45 exercises are blocked
  on different things. The two workstreams are genuinely parallel.
- Not the protocol, not a job, not a server, not a page. The lab already splits every adapter so
  that only the last file knows about Fenix Spoon (`solvers/__init__.py`), which makes the spike
  one NumPy/SciPy module and one test file — the shape `panel.py` and `truss.py` already have.
- **Not the `P45` archive.** The fifty frequencies are published and are quoted in
  [§8 of the exercise](../exercises/adaptive-mirror.md#8-verification). The archive is needed for
  the *time-history* regression, which belongs to solve B and is not on this path.
- Not Exercise 5. The sensor model enters at the control loop, not at the plant.

That last cluster is the actual argument for doing this now: of everything Exercise 6 needs, the
plate's modal benchmark is the one piece that depends on nothing else and settles the most.

---

## 5. What it costs, stated honestly

For calibration, the bridge — the most recent comparable exercise — is 358 lines of method and
441 of test before any protocol adapter. A shear-deformable plate with its locking treatment
(MITC-style tying, reduced integration, or a stabilised formulation — the choice is part of the
spike) plus a generalised eigensolve will be **the largest single piece of physics the lab has
written**. The spike itself is much smaller than the exercise: it stops at the frequencies, and
it either matches the table or it does not.

The control loop, by contrast, is a few hundred lines of NumPy and has already been written
twice in `P45`. It is not where the risk is, and it is not what this proposal is about.

---

## 6. What is being asked for

1. ~~**Open an issue upstream for the modal solve**~~ — **done, and answered**:
   [fenix-spoon#101](https://github.com/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon/issues/101) was opened on the
   pattern of [#100](https://github.com/mandaloriat/fenix-spoon/issues/100), and both are now
   closed and shipped — the eigensolve in protocol 1.14 as `mock.modal2d` and its FEniCSx twin,
   the axisymmetric kind in 1.13. The lab has been running both since its pin moved to 1.17.
   The issue carried the room-modes row and the mirror as the two consumers, the `series.py`
   table and the `static` assumption as the evidence that the toolkit had already half-agreed,
   and it kept the plate element explicitly out of scope. **That separation is what this
   document was for, and it held**: ask A went upstream and came back, ask B is still the
   lab's.
2. **Approve the plate spike in the lab** — the element and the eigen-check against the fifty
   frequencies, and nothing downstream of them.
3. **Defer the ownership question on the element** until the spike passes, then offer it
   upstream with its benchmark.

~~**If the answer upstream is no on the modal solve**~~ — it was yes, so this contingency lapsed
unspent. It is kept below because the cost it named is the reason the ask was made upstream at
all rather than worked around locally, and the next ask of this kind will want the argument:
the fallback would have been the **second** local workaround on the P45 thread, after the
axisymmetric convention #100 already accepts one
of. §11 of the sensor exercise authorises that kind of thing *once and explicitly not twice*,
and two of them is the point at which the lab has quietly forked the toolkit's job.
